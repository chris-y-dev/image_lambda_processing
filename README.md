# Upload image and auto-resize: A local AWS and API application

![alt](./readme_images/thumbnail_program_workflow.jpg)

This application includes a local API that allows you to upload an image. If the image is in a valid format (jpg/png), the image will be uploaded to a locally hosted AWS S3 bucket, which triggers a Lambda Function to generate and upload re-sized thumnbnails of the image to these following sizes:

- small: 200x200px
- medium: 350x350px
- large: 500x500px
- x-large: 700x700px

---

# How to run the application 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️

## 1. Clone the repository 💾

---

## 2. Build and start Docker containers 🐳

In the root directory, run this command to build the Docker containers:

`docker-compose build`

After the build, run command to start the Docker containers:

`docker-compose up -d`

---

## 3. Open up the API on your browser 💻

`http://localhost:5035/swagger/index.html`

---

## 4. Access the AWS S3 buckets on your browser ☁

The "input" bucket is where the original uploaded image will be saved to.
`http://localhost:4566/input`

Images uploaded to the "input" bucket will trigger the Lambda function, which uploads the re-sized images into the "output" bucket.

`http://localhost:4566/output`

## 5. Upload an image using the API 🖼

You can upload your own image (.jpg or .png files), or try the cool_cat.jpg provided in the directory root :)

`./cool_cat.jpg`

After successfully uploading, you can find the original image in the "input" bucket.

The Lambda Function will then retrieve this image uploaded and process it into different sizes, and upload them all to the "output" bucket

## 6. Try saving the re-sized image! 🖼🖼🖼🖼

You can save and view the processed images by putting them in to the URL :)

`http://localhost:4566/output/<your-image-name.jpg>`
